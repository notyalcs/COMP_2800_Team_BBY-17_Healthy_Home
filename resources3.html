            <div class="button2"><ul><li><p>Keep a bottle of water with you during the day. To reduce your costs, carry a reusable water bottle and fill it with tap water.</p></li><li><p>
                If you don’t like the taste of plain water, try adding a slice of lemon or lime to your drink.
                Drink water before, during, and after a workout.</p></li><li><p>
                When you’re feeling hungry, drink water. Thirst is often confused with hunger. True hunger will not be satisfied by drinking water. Drinking water may also contribute to a healthy weight-loss plan. Some research suggests that drinking water can help you feel full.</p></li><li><p>
                If you have trouble remembering to drink water, drink on a schedule. For example, drink water when you wake up, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and when you go to bed. Or, drink a small glass of water at the beginning of each hour.</p></li></ul></div>
            <div class="button2"><ul><li><p>
                If you are concerned that you are not drinking enough water, check your urine. If your urine is usually colorless or light yellow, you are well hydrated. If your urine is a dark yellow or amber color, you may be dehydrated.</p></li><li><p>
                Water is best for staying hydrated. However, fruit and vegetable juices, milk, and herbal teas add to the amount of water you get each day. Even caffeinated drinks (for example, coffee, tea, and soda) can contribute to your daily water intake.</p></li><li><p>
                Water can also be found in fruits and vegetables (for example, watermelon, tomatoes, and lettuce), and in soup broths.</p></li></ul></div>
