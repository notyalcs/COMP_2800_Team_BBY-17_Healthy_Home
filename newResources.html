    <!--Posture facts / tips-->
    <div class='info' id='postureInfo'>
        <h3>Posture</h3>


        <p>Proper posture can make breathing easier and deeper, as your ribs may compress your abdomen when slouched
            over.</p>
        <p>Bad posture is a proven factor in the regression of the body's spinal structure, consequentially leading to
            chronic back pain.</p>
        <p>Most cases of back pain are mechanical or non-organicâ€”resulting primarily from domains where posture is
            neglected. (eg. Jobsites, offices, etc.)</p>
        <p>Poor head and neck posture can increase the load on the cervical spine by over three times the normal amount.
            This can result in muscle imbalances, elevated risk for spinal degeneration, and reduced mobility.</p>

    <!--hydration facts / tips-->
    <div class='info' id='hydrationInfo'>
        <h3>Hydration</h3>


        <p>Dehydration has been associated with adverse health impacts, such as kidney stones, constipation, and acne.
        </p>
        <p>Dehydration by as little as 1-2% of your body weight has been found to result in substantial temporary
            cognitive decline.</p>
        <p>Hydration can be assessed through the shade of one's urine. Light yellow or clear urine is a sign of healthy
            levels of hydration.</p>
        <p>Hydration is associated with a boosted metabolism. This can promote weight loss and weight maintenance.</p>

    <!--sleep facts / tips-->
    <div class='info' id='sleepInfo'>
        <h3>Sleep</h3>


        <p>In general, most healthy adults need seven to nine hours of sleep a night.</p>
        <p>High quality sleep has been linked to increased cognition, concentration, and productivity.</p>
        <p>Blue light from electronic devices can disrupt circadian rythems which can affect both your ability to fall
            asleep and your sleep quality.</p>
        <p>Melatonin is a naturally occuring hormone that can be purchased in tablets. It can aid in inducing sleep, and
            promotes a higher quality of sleep throughout the night.</p>

    <!--stretching facts / tips-->
    <div class='info' id='stretchingInfo'>
        <h3>Stretching</h3>

      

        <p>Stretching keeps muscles flexible and promotes joint mobility.</p>
        <p>When tight muscles are recruited for strenuous activity they are more vulnerable to damage and may not be
            able to adequately support stress on the joints.</p>
        <p>Flexibility is built over time. The benefits of stretching may not be immediately apparent, and the process
            may take weeks or months to begin to see notable progress.</p>
        <p>Stretching increases blood flow, boosts oxygen levels and helps deliver nutrients to your muscles. It also
            removes metabolic waste such as carbon dioxide, ammonia and uric acid.</p>
        <p>The American Chiropractic Association strongly advocates responsible stretching before and after all physical
            activity</p>

    <!--exercise facts / tips-->
    <div class='info' id='exerciseInfo'>
        <h3>Exercise</h3>


        <p>Consistent exercise is associated with increased prefrontal cortex and medial temporal cortex mass, and is
            correlated to elevated cognitive performance.</p>
        <p>The National Health Service recommends 150 minutes of exercise per week. This correlates to 30 minutes of
            activity 5 days a week.</p>
        <p>Regular exercise is associated with icnreased quality of sleep, which comes with its own myriad of benefits.
        </p>
        <p>When exercising make sure to be listen to your body. If something doesn't feel right make sure to stop to
            avoid potentially serious injury.</p>
        <p>Form is important. Make sure that you are exercising with the correct form to properly activate your muscles
            and to avoid injury.</p>
