    <div class='info' id='postureInfo'>
        <h3>Posture</h3>
        <p>It helps our muscles and joints. Good posture helps us keep our bones and joints in correct alignment so that our muscles are used correctly, decreasing wear and tear on our joints.</p>
        <p>Breathing becomes easier and deeper. When we slouch, our ribcage can sink down towards our abdomen which can cause a restriction to deep breathing. Good posture allows our ribs to expand more easily.</p>
        <p>It improves circulation and digestion. Poor posture can cause undue compression of the internal organs in the abdomen. Good, upright posture allows the organs to assume their natural position and function.</p>
        <p>It portrays a better image. Good posture helps boost our self-confidence. In front of a mirror, take a deep breath and stand up straight. Then slump over. See the difference?</p>
        <p>It gives us a positive mindset. Posture affects our frame of mind, and our frame of mind can affect our posture. So, when we are well and happy, our posture tends to be upright and open. In contrast, when we feel down or in pain, we often sit or stand slouched.</p>

    <div class='info' id='hydrationInfo'>
        <h3>Hydration</h3>
        <p>Excretion: a person can lose a pint to several gallons of urine a day.</p>
        <p>Breathing: when we inhale, moisture is added to the air as it passes to our lungs. The humidified air is then lost, once we exhale and the amount of water lost depends on the levels of humidity of the air.</p>
        <p>Sweating: we lose a under a liter of water daily when it evaporates from the skin. This amount can increase dramatically when we sweat profusely due to vigorous workouts or high body temperature.</p>
        <p>Digestion: generally, we lose little water through the digestive track. However, in the case of severe diarrhoea and vomiting, a gallon or more can be lost.</p>
        <p>Water is the main component of blood, which supplies cells with oxygen and nutrients and carries waste out of the body. Water lubricates joints. Water cushions vital organs</p>

    <div class='info' id='sleepInfo'>
        <h3>Sleep</h3>
        <p>Man is the only mammal that willingly delays sleep.</p>
        <p>The higher the altitude, the greater the sleep disruption. Generally, sleep disturbance becomes greater at altitudes of 13,200 feet or more. The disturbance is thought to be caused by diminished oxygen levels and accompanying changes in respiration. Most people adjust to new altitudes in approximately two to three weeks.</p>
        <p>We naturally feel tired at two different times of the day: about 2:00 AM and 2:00 PM. It is this natural dip in alertness that is primarily responsible for the post-lunch dip.</p>
        <p>People who don’t get enough sleep are more likely to have bigger appetites due to the fact that their leptin levels (leptin is an appetite-regulating hormone) fall, promoting appetite increase.</p>
        <p>In general, most healthy adults need seven to nine hours of sleep a night. However, some individuals are able to function without sleepiness or drowsiness after as little as six hours of sleep. Others can’t perform at their peak unless they’ve slept ten hours.</p>

    <div class='info' id='stretchingInfo'>
        <h3>Stretching</h3>
        <p>You should warm up first, then stretch. Many amateurs assume it’s best to stretch before you run or take part in any type of exercise. Actually, it’s better if you warm up first.</p>
        <p>Our muscle fibers are very pliable. It might surprise you to know that a muscle can stretch up to one and a half times its original length.</p>
        <p>You need to stretch more than just muscles and tendons. Before hitting the road or the treadmill, it’s imperative that you stretch your hamstrings, quads and calves.</p>
        <p>Stretching is for more than just athletes. Runners and those who compete in athletic events are well aware of the benefits of stretching, but it may come as a surprise that it also helps patients with conditions such as diabetes and depression. In fact, recent studies show that stretching during yoga classes can even benefit women who are battling breast cancer.</p>
        <p>Stretching increases blood flow, boosts oxygen levels and helps deliver nutrients to your muscles. It also removes metabolic waste such as carbon dioxide, ammonia and uric acid.</p>

    <div class='info' id='meditationInfo'>
        <h3>Meditation</h3>
        <p>Meditation as a practice is thought to be around 2,600 years old.</p>
        <p>The global wellness industry is currently valued at $4.2 trillion.</p>
        <p>In fact the industry, which includes meditation, grew 6.4% annually, almost double the rate of overall global economic growth which grew just 3.6%.</p>
        <p>Meditation can change your brain to improve memory and concentration.</p>
        <p>Meditation can help to delay the onset of Alzheimer’s Disease. Meditation can be a more effective painkiller than  morphine.</p>

    <div class='info' id='exerciseInfo'>
        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>Listening to music while exercising can improve work out performance by 15%.</p>
        <p>The more muscle mass you have, the more fat your body burns while resting.</p>
        <p>Sweat releases dirt through your pores, which reduces acne and breakouts. Workouts improve the overall look of your skin.</p>
        <p>If you are someone who has trouble sleeping or staying asleep, then working out is your answer. Exercise helps to clear your head and helps you feel relaxed.</p>
        <p>Cardiovascular exercise helps create new brain cells. This enhances brainpower and brain activity.</p>
