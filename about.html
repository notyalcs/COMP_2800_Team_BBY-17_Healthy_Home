            <p id="groupPara">We are a group in COMP 2800 at the British Columbia Institute of Technology. During these unprecidented times, we have decided to come up with a web application to help people that are working from home maintain a healthy life. Our flagship app is called Healthy Home. It allows users to set up reminders to break up a stagnent working experience and provides information regarding a number of topics to keep people healthy. We are dedicated to our users and hope that everyone is keeping a Healthy Home!</p>
